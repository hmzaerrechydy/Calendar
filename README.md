# Calendar
## About 
A calendar web application, this is a coding challenge I got from a startup, 

I didn't have any clue
I built this in 14 days







## Features
1. Add, read, update and delete events.
2. Four views: year, month, week and day.
3. Select the start and end time in the UI.
## I built this with: 
- Django
- Django REST framework
- SQLite
- React + Vite
- Material UI
- [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/react)

You can clone the project and run it in your machine to learn how it works.
